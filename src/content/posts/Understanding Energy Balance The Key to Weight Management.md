##  **Why 'Calories In, Calories Out' Is Still King (And Why Your Diet Choice Still Matters)**

Ever been told that weight loss is just "calories in, calories out," only to find that your friend on a Keto diet is shedding pounds faster than you are on a low-fat diet, despite eating the same number of calories? It's a common frustration that leads many to believe the energy balance equation is a myth. But the truth is more nuanced.

While the law of "calories in, calories out" (CICO) is undeniable, not all diets are created equal because they can significantly influence the "calories out" side of the equation. Let’s break down the hidden factors that make up your metabolism and see how you can make them work for you.

## **Understanding “Calories in and Calorie Out”**

“Calories in” is simply the energy you consume from food and drink  “Calories out,” or Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), however is a bit more complex and made up of four parts:

- **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** About 60–70% of your daily burn comes from keeping your body alive e.g. breathing, pumping blood, repairing cells. This is the energy you use at complete rest.  
- **Non-Exercise Activity (NEAT):** All the little movements you do without thinking, like walking, fidgeting, or typing. NEAT can rise when you eat more and drop when you’re in a calorie deficit.  
- **Exercise Activity (EA):** The calories you burn through intentional workouts like running, lifting, or cycling.  
- **Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):** The energy needed to digest and process what you eat. Protein burns the most, followed by carbs, then fats.  

Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the total of these factors and can change daily based on activity and food intake, but the basic energy balance equation always applies. Diets with the same number of calories can lead to different results because they affect Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) or appetite. For example:

- **High-protein diets** raise the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) since protein takes more energy to digest, slightly increasing “calories out.”  
- **Filling diets** (like those high in fiber or protein) can curb hunger, which may naturally reduce “calories in.”  
- **Energizing diets** can boost Non-Exercise Activity (NEAT) (daily movement) or *Exercise Activity (EA): by making you feel more active.

These effects operate within the energy balance framework, not outside it, explaining why one diet may feel more effective for an individual.

## **Practical Takeaways for Effective Weight Management**

Understanding energy balance empowers you to make smarter choices. To put this into practice, make protein a priority, as its high Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) boosts your “calories out” while its satiating effect helps control your “calories in.” In addition to diet, focus on moving more in every way by incorporating both planned Exercise Activity (EA) and daily Non-Exercise Activity (NEAT), such as taking the stairs, walking while on the phone, and finding small excuses to move. To ensure you’re on track, briefly use a food diary or app to get an honest look at your “calories in,” because awareness is the first step to change. Above all, choose a sustainable eating pattern that aligns with your lifestyle and preferences, as the best diet is always the one you can stick with long-term.

## **Conclusion**

Energy balance is the unyielding foundation of weight management. By understanding and leveraging the components of TDEE—BMR, NEAT, EA, and TEF—you can see through dietary fads and build a personalized, effective approach to achieving your weight goals. Whether you prefer keto, low-fat, carnivore, vegan or any another diet, success hinges on managing the balance between calories in and calories out.
